**MacroRePlayer** is an application designed for **recording**, **editing**, and **replaying** mouse and keyboard events. The main goal is to simplify the automation of repetitive tasks on a computer without the need to write custom scripts. The project is designed to provide a user-friendly interface with **maximum control** over recorded events, and will eventually allow additional advanced features like custom loops, infinite replay, or adjustable speeds.

## Detailed Use üìñ

### Record
1. Click **Start Recoring** (or use a defined keybind).
2. The application begins recording all mouse and keyboard actions in the order they're performed.
3. When finished, click **Stop Recording** (or the same keybind) again to stop.
4. And it will save the sessions as `.json` files

### Edit
1. Click the **Open Editor** button
2. The Editor window will appear. Then, select your `.json` file from the dropdown menu to display a complete timeline of all recorded events in the list.
2. You can:
    - **‚Üë/‚Üì Arrow Keys** ‚Äì Move events up or down in the timeline. (Fun fact: Holding an arrow key will instantly move the selected event to the top/bottom!)
   - **Delete** - Remove unwanted events.
   - **Copy** actions to quickly duplicate the events.
   - **Extract** will delete and copy the action to quickly rearrange the events
   - **Insert** copied event under selected item
   - **Adjust time delays** between events.
   - Insert **conditions, loops** (TODO).

### (Re)Play
1. Set a **keybind** to **Start** / **Stop** the playback (optional). 
2. In the **Player** window, choose:
   - **Mode** (one-time, repeat X times, infinite) (TODO).
   - **Speed** (from 0.25√ó to 10√ó) (TODO).
3. Click **Start Playing Macro** (or use the defined keybind) to start (Re)Playing all recorded actions.
4. Playback can be **stopped** at any time using the same defined keybind or by pressing **Stop Playing Macro**.

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è (TODO)
- the `.cfg` file should create automatically when needed to save some data and by default it should look like this
[Settings]
autosave = true
theme = "white"
default_speed = 1
startup_delay = 1000
hotkey_record = ""
hotkey_play = ""

## Planned Features üó∫Ô∏è (TODO)

- **Repeat**: Replay the macro a specific number of times or indefinitely.
- **Variable speeds**: Adjust playback speed up to 10√ó or slow it down to 0.25√ó.
- **Advanced loops**: Create your own loops or conditional logic (e.g.,`for loop`).
- **Save and load macros**: Export and share macros with others.
- **startup delay**
- **setting form**: with option tu execute macro in python (it won't be soon) and skin etc.
